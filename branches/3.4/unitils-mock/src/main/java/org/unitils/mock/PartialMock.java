 * that provides access to the actual partial mock object.
 * <p/>
 * If Unitils encounters a field declared as {@link PartialMock}, a {@link MockObject} is automatically instantiated and
 * assigned to the declared field. This mock object will use the original implementation of each method as default
 * behavior.
