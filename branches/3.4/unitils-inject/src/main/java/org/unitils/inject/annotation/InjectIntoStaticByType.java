/**
 * Annotation indicating that the {@link org.unitils.inject.InjectModule} should try to inject the object assigned to
 * the annotated field to a static property of the class defined by the target attribute.
 * <p/>
 * Automatic injection by type is used, which means that a the object is injected to the most specific static property
 * with an assignable type.
 * <p/>
 * You can also specify what action needs to be performed after the test. Suppose, for example, that you want to
 * mock a singleton instance by injecting the mock into the static <code>singleton</code> variable. After the test
 * was performed, you typically want to restore the old (real) singleton value, so that the next test can run with
 * the normal instance. This can be done by setting the resetType to the OLD_VALUE value. You can also specify that
 * the static instance should be cleared by setting it to null (or 0) or just leave the injected value.
