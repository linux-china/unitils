/**
 * Test written for bugfix: if a mocked method returns another mock object, this other mock object is cloned
 * at each invocation and added to the scenario. Because the mock object references the scenario, the scenario
 * itself is also cloned each time. The result is that, at each invocation, the amount of objects which is cloned
 * is twice the amount of the previous one. This quickly results in a large time delay. The bug fix involves that
 * the mock object proxy now implements the {@link Cloneable} interface and the {@link Object#clone()} method
 * returns the mock object proxy itself.
